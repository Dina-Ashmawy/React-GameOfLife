# Game of Life
A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life using React.

## Overview
This React component represents the Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. It consists of a grid of cells, and each cell can be alive or dead based on a set of rules. The game evolves over time, creating interesting patterns.
